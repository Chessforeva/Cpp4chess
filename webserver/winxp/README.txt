mimes.ini

Not advanced, nossl, no gzip transfers, just can get files.
For people holding good intentions.

Hack, but can help moving valuable family content.

Before starting the webserver, can run command prompt (Start cmd),
  move to current folder and run command
  dir *.* /s > content.txt

Now can see all the files and subfolders, read content.txt first.

Use inside the local network
  or configure router settings (ip,port) to allow access from outside.
 
It does not solve 2-byte unicode filenames in various languages,
 but files always can be renamed or zipped inside a download pack.
