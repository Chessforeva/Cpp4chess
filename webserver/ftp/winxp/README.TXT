This is FTP tool to access old Windows PC.
TinyC compiled.

ftp_xp.exe server does it in a single connection, without user list,
no unicode, no ssl, ...., no, no...

It can serve Windows cmd.exe > ftp.exe
Or other ftp client app.
Features are Passive or port, active or binary data sending.
Simple, small, does nothing but requires nothing too.

Place it in a folder and run.
The current folder of the application becomes the root "/"
Put and get, and rename, and delete too.

In fact, it works well in local network.
The router and firewall also blocking ftp too.
Nowadays just use web-browser and download the needed things.
The www_xp.exe, for example, can do the same.

Anyway, better get zipper on that PC, zip the content and
 send or download from elsewhere. No need look each file.

FTP is very old crap.
