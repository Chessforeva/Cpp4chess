#### Other tools

<b>jsObfsc</b> is a source code minifier for javascript interpreter. Developed for slow javascripts in browsers long time ago.

<b>Sitemap</b> makes a html document that has good links for folders and files on webservers, but also is like a tree of filesystem. Actually it also helps making Google sitemap.xml.
